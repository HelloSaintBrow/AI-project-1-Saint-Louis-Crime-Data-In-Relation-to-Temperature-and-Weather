# Crime Trends Analysis in St. Louis, MO (2021-2023)

This project uses Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to examine crime trends in St. Louis, Missouri, from 2021 to 2023. We chose to focus on St. Louis due to its designation as the city with the highest crime rates in the United States, making its dataset particularly rich and insightful for analysis. The goal of this project is to analyze how crime has evolved over this period and answer key questions about its patterns. Specifically, the project will explore whether crime has increased or decreased, how it varies by season, and how different types of crime—such as violent, property, and drug-related offenses—have changed over time. Additionally, the analysis will investigate if crime trends differ by time of day and identify the time of year with the least amount of crime. By examining these factors, the project aims to provide a clearer understanding of crime trends in St. Louis and reveal where and when crime is most concentrated throughout the year.

### Key Questions:

1. **Has crime decreased or increased in St. Louis from 2021 to 2023?**
2. **Does crime peak by season of the year (winter, spring, summer, fall)?**
3. **How have different types of crime (e.g., violent, property, drug-related) increased or decreased?**
4. **Do crimes trend a certain way compared to the time of day?**
5. **What time of year has the least amount of crime?**

## Project Objectives

### 1. **Data Collection & Cleaning**

- Compile and preprocess datasets that include crime records (type, location, time) and seasonal data for St. Louis.
- Ensure data consistency and accuracy for effective analysis.

### 2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

- Summarize key characteristics of crime data to identify overall trends.
- Use visualizations and correlation analysis to uncover relationships between crime rates and seasonal factors.
- Investigate how different types of crime (violent, property, drug-related) have evolved over time.

### 3. **Time and Seasonal Analysis**

- Examine fluctuations in crime rates across different times of the day, days of the week, and seasons of the year.
- Identify any seasonal or temporal patterns in crime incidents, such as spikes in specific months or times.

### 4. **Crime Type Analysis**

- Analyze how specific types of crime have increased or decreased over the period.
- Identify if certain crimes tend to peak during specific seasons or times of day.

## Why It Matters

Understanding crime trends is crucial for developing effective public safety strategies and policies. By analyzing crime patterns in St. Louis from 2021 to 2023, this project aims to uncover key insights into how crime has evolved over time, how it fluctuates with the seasons, and which types of crime are on the rise or decline. These insights are valuable for law enforcement, policymakers, and community leaders who need data-driven strategies to address crime in a targeted and timely manner.

Moreover, identifying patterns in crime by time of day or year can help optimize resource allocation, ensuring that law enforcement and public safety initiatives are focused during peak crime periods. If certain times of the year, such as winter or summer, experience higher crime rates, targeted prevention measures can be put in place. This project also seeks to inform urban planning and community development efforts by pinpointing areas with higher crime concentrations.

Ultimately, understanding how crime trends shift over time and in relation to external factors empowers local authorities and citizens alike to take proactive steps in improving safety and quality of life in St. Louis.

## Next Steps

1. **Refining Analysis**  
   Conduct deeper analysis on seasonal and time-of-day crime patterns to identify trends and anomalies that can inform targeted crime prevention strategies.

2. **Predictive Modeling**  
   Develop and test predictive models to forecast future crime trends based on historical data. This could help law enforcement anticipate potential crime spikes and allocate resources more effectively.


3. **Weather Impact Study**  
   Investigate the relationship between weather conditions (e.g., temperature, precipitation) and crime rates. Understanding whether specific weather patterns influence crime could help law enforcement plan for weather-related spikes in criminal activity.

4. **Policy Recommendations**  
   Based on the analysis, develop actionable recommendations for law enforcement, policymakers, and urban planners to reduce crime and improve public safety in St. Louis.

## Research Approach

We used a **descriptive analysis method** for this project, which involves summarizing raw data to provide basic insights, such as averages, counts, and trends. This approach helps answer **"what happened"** questions by examining the overall patterns and changes in crime over time.

## Datasets

### 1. **St. Louis Crime Data**

- **Description**: This dataset contains records of reported crimes in St. Louis from 2021 to 2023, including details such as crime type, location, date, and time. It provides a comprehensive overview of crime trends across the city. We focused on data fields reflecting the types of crimes, times of day crimes were committed, monthly rates of crimes, seasonal rates of crimes, and yearly data values, allowing for a thorough exploration of how crime patterns have evolved over time.
