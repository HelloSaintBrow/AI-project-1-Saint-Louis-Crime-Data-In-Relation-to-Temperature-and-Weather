# Crime and Weather Analysis in St. Louis, MO

This project uses Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to examine a dataset of crime incidents, temperature, and weather conditions in St. Louis, Missouri. The objective is to identify potential connections or trends between crime rates and various weather factors, such as temperature, precipitation, and other environmental variables. Through this analysis, the project seeks to shed light on how weather might impact crime patterns in the city.

### Key Questions:

1. **Has crime decreased or increased in St. Louis from 2021 to 2023?**
2. **Does crime peak by season of the year (winter, spring, summer, fall)?**
3. **How have different types of crime (e.g., violent, property, drug-related) increased or decreased?**
4. **Do crimes trend a certain way compared to the time of day?**
5. **What time of year has the least amount of crime?**

## Project Objectives

- **Data Collection & Cleaning**: Compile and preprocess datasets that include crime records (type, location, time) and weather data (temperature, precipitation, humidity, etc.) for St. Louis, ensuring the data is clean, consistent, and ready for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
  - Summarize the key characteristics of the crime and weather data.
  - Use visualizations and correlation analysis to explore the relationship between weather conditions (temperature, precipitation, etc.) and various types of crime.
  - Investigate whether extreme weather events (e.g., heatwaves or cold fronts) have a notable impact on crime rates.
- **Time and Seasonal Analysis**:
  - Examine how crime rates fluctuate across different times of the day, days of the week, and seasons in relation to weather conditions.

## Why It Matters

Understanding the relationship between weather and crime patterns can provide valuable insights into how environmental factors influence public safety. If certain weather conditions, such as extreme heat or rain, correlate with increased crime rates, this information could help law enforcement and urban planners devise more effective strategies for resource allocation, crime prevention, and public safety during specific weather events or times of day.

## Next Steps

- **Predictive Modeling**: Build models to predict the likelihood of crime under varying weather conditions.
- **Geospatial Analysis**: Integrate geographical data to study how crime rates in different parts of St. Louis correlate with weather patterns.
- **Actionable Insights**: Develop recommendations for city officials, police departments, and urban planners to enhance safety based on weather-related crime patterns.

## Datasets

- **Crime Data**: St. Louis crime records, including crime type, location, date, and time.
- **Weather Data**: Historical daily weather data for St. Louis, including temperature, humidity, precipitation, and extreme weather events.

## Tools and Libraries

The following tools and libraries were used for analysis and development:

- **Python**: Programming language for data processing, analysis, and visualization.
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: Numerical computing and data manipulation.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Data visualization libraries for creating plots and charts.
- **Scikit-learn**: For statistical analysis and potential predictive modeling.
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: For documenting and sharing the analysis process interactively.
- **Visual Studio Code**: Development environment used for coding, debugging, and project management.
